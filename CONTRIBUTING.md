# Contributing to the Internship List
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Luka & Ali Internship List (inspired by [Pitt CSC and Simplify](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2024-Internships))!

## Finding an Internship to Add
We ask that the internships that you add meet some requirements. Specifically, your internship must
- be in one of the following categories:
    - software/computer engineering
    - computer/data science
    - product management
    - quant
    - any other tech-related internships
- be located in Canada, or remote.
- not already exist in the internship list.

## Adding an Internship
Cool! You're ready to add an internship to the list. Follow these steps:

1) First create a new issue [here](https://github.com/lucianlavric/CanadaTechInternships-Summer2026/issues/new/choose).
2) Select the **New Internship** issue template.
3) Fill in the information about your internship into the form, then hit submit.
> Please make a new submission for each unique position, **even if they are for the same company**.
4) That's it! Once a member of our team has reviewed your submission, it will be automatically added to the correct `README`

## Automatic README.md Updates
A script will automatically add new contributions to the appropriate README. The row will look something like this:
```md
